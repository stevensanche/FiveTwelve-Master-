"""
Key press acquisition and interpretation. 
This module is closely bound to the view 
component. If a different view component is used, 
a corresponding keypress module must be used 
with it.  For example, we could have a pure textual
"glass tty" interface using curses, and in that case 
we would need to use curses functions to obtain keystrokes.
